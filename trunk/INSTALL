Installation Instructions
-------------------------

Nethack-Records requires Perl 5 and CGI capable webserver.
It also requires HTML::Template installed,
but I have included it in the distribution, no further installation 
is required on that part. Put the script and all the templates
in a cgi-enabled webfolder and it is good to go.

Oh, by the way, the scripts need access to the nethack-logfile, 
and you have to make sure it can read it by editing the "options.cfg"
in the script dir. If your webserver does not have access to the logfile
directly you have to set up a cronjob or something to copy the
file where the script can read it.
