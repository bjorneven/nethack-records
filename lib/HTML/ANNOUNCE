DESCRIPTION

    This module attempts to make using HTML templates simple and natural. It
    extends standard HTML with a few new HTML-esque tags - <TMPL_VAR>,
    <TMPL_LOOP>, <TMPL_INCLUDE>, <TMPL_IF>, <TMPL_ELSE> and <TMPL_UNLESS>.
    The file written with HTML and these new tags is called a template. It
    is usually saved separate from your script - possibly even created by
    someone else! Using this module you fill in the values for the
    variables, loops and branches declared in the template. This allows you
    to separate design - the HTML - from the data, which you generate in the
    Perl script.

    This module is licensed under the GPL. See the LICENSE section below for
    more details.
