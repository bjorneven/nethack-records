Installation Instructions
-------------------------

Nethack-Records requires
 - Perl 5 and CGI capable webserver.
 - It also requires HTML::Template installed,
   but I have included it in the distribution, no further installation 
   is required on that part. Put the script and all the templates
   in a cgi-enabled webfolder and it is good to go.

Oh, by the way, the scripts need access to
 - the nethack-logfile
 - and you have to make sure it can read it by editing the "options.cfg"
   in the script dir.
 - If your webserver does not have access to the logfile
   directly you have to set up a cronjob or something to copy the
   file where the script can read it.

Modify the placement of options.cfg
-----------------------------------

If you need to move the options file to another place, edit index.cgi to reflect
this. The webserver needs read-permissions to this file.

Installation on a cgi-bin/ environment
--------------------------------------

Often, the cgi-bin/ folder of Apache has very restrictive permissions. Therefore
the webbrowser cannot access the css and image-files placed by default inside the 
script-directory.

To remedy this, move the img/ and css/ directories outside of cgi-bin and modify
the variables "css_path" and "img_path" in options.cfg according to the URI path. 
Note that these files need to be in the webserver-directory as they are read by 
a webbrowser, and not the script. 

Example:
Script is in http://example.com/cgi-bin/nhrec/, which is at /var/www/example.com/cgi-bin/nhrec 
on the filesystem. The variable "uri" in options.cfg should then be

uri="http://example.com/cgi-bin/nhrec/";

Move img/ and css/ to a directory, say /var/www/example.com/nhrec/. Then, edit
css_path and img_path to 

css_path="/nhrec/css/";
img_path="/nhrec/img/";

Now the webserver will again find the files requested, and all is good.
