Upgrading from 0.5.0 to 0.5.1
------------------------------

* Make a backup of your original options.cfg file, and possibly the 
  logfile if it is kept in the same folder.
* Unpack the new 0.5.1 installation over the old installation, 
  or make a new directory.
* There is a small change to the options.cfg file, but otherwise
  all your options from the original options file is compatible 
  with the new. You have to merge your old options into the new one
  manually.
