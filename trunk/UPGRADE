Upgrading from 0.5.0 to 0.5.1
------------------------------

* Make a backup of your options.cfg
* Unpack the new 0.5.1 installation over the old installation, 
  or make a new directory.
* Copy options.cfg-default to options.cfg, or edit the index.cgi 
  to reflect the name of this file.
* Take the old values from your backup options.cfg and merge them
  into the new.
* There is a small change to the options.cfg file, but otherwise
  all your options from the original options file is compatible 
  with the new.
